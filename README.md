# React + Ruby on Rails To-do Application âœ…

## Description

After a long break from programming with React, I decided to make a simple Todo application using **React** in the frontend and **Ruby on Rails** in the backend.

## Features

- Add items to to-do List
- Add optional tags to items
- Change, remove, and delete tags from items
- Complete items (moved to the top of the list)
- Move items (not above completed items)
- Delete items from the list

## Setup

To get started, you need to run the backend and frontend servers.

### Backend

    # Change directory
    cd backend
    # Install Packages
    bundle install 
    # Setup database
    rails db:migrate
    # Start backend server
    rail s

### Frontend

    # Change directory
    cd frontend
    # Install packages
    npm i
    # Start server
    npm run dev

### Open localhost

Go to your preferred browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`
